# 189. Rotate Array

## Clarification

- k is a non-negative number.
  - k may be zero.
  - k may be larger than the size of an array.

## Possible solutions

- Move elements step by step.
  - O(N^2) time complexity.
  - O(1) space complexity.
- Copy and move the array.
  - O(1) time complexity.
  - O(N) space complexity.
- Use Cyclic Replacements.
  - O(N) time complexity.
  - O(1) space complexity.
- Use reverse.
  - O(N) time complexity.
  - O(1) space complexity.
