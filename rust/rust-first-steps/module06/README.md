# Implement generic types and traits

[Implement generic types and traits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/rust-generic-types-traits/) is a module on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/).

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

- What generic types are and how "wrapper" types use them.
- What traits are and how they help us define shared behavior.
- How to implement an existing trait for a custom type.
- How to implement a custom trait for an existing type.
- How trait bounds help us write generic functions.
- How to implement an `Iterator` trait to iterate through collections.

## Exercises

1. [Implement a generic type](./exercise01)
2. [Implement an iterator](./exercise02)
