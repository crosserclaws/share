# Handle errors in Rust

[Handle errors in Rust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/rust-error-handling/) is a module on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/).

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Use `panic!` to deal with unrecoverable errors.
- Use the `Option` enum when a value is optional or the lack of a value is not an error condition.
- Use the `Result` enum when things could go wrong and a caller might have to deal with the problem.
